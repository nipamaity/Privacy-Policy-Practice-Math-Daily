            <li>To communicate with you, including responding to inquiries or feedback.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our app may include links to or interactions with third-party services, such as Google Play Services. Please be aware that these third parties have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app, <strong>Practice Math Daily</strong>, is intended for use by children under the age of 13 for educational purposes. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children and comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Our app does not collect personal information such as names, emails, or physical addresses.

Google limits data collection for children-directed services and ensures that AdMob complies with COPPA.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> As we do not collect personal information directly, we do not require parental consent. However, if you have concerns about the data collected by third-party ad providers, you may contact us, and we will assist in addressing those concerns or provide instructions on how to opt out of data collection where applicable.</p>
